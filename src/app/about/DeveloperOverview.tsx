          After dedicating almost a decade to assisting companies in narrating
          their stories through branding and digital marketing campaigns, I
          sensed the need for a change. Having successfully guided numerous
          companies through rebrands and website redesigns, I had acquired
          substantial expertise in HTML and CSS, reaching a level of comfort
          with each‚Äîthis heightened my curiosity, compelling me to delve deeper
          into these areas, eager to expand my knowledge.

          <p>
            So in 2020, I decided to do just that. I plunged headfirst into the
            realm of technology, resigning from my job in Utah, relocating my
            family across the country to Richmond, Virginia, and enrolling in a
            rigorous 6-month coding bootcamp at the University of Richmond to
            pave my way toward becoming a full-stack web developer.

            Immediately following my completion of and graduation from bootcamp,
            I landed my first full-time role as a developer at Paymerang‚Äîa
            fintech company based here in Richmond, VA. As a full stack software
            developer at Paymerang, I worked in a fast-paced environment,
            contributing to the development of complex web applications using a
            diverse set of cutting-edge technologies. My primary focus was on
            building responsive user interfaces using React with the Remix
            framework (JavaScript/Typescript), and designing/implementing
            scalable back-end systems using Hasura (GraphQL & SQL).

          <p className="mt-3">
            In this role, I was responsible for the complete software
            development lifecycle, including design, development, creating unit
            tests, and providing deployment instructions. I collaborated closely
            with cross-functional teams, including product managers, designers,
            and other engineers, ensuring alignment with the company's business
            goals and user needs.
